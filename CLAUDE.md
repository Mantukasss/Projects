# Personal app portfolio — hub repo

This is a **personal app portfolio**. This repo is the **hub** — a launcher that lists every app built here and lets the owner (and friends they share with) pick which one to open. Each "app" is a folder under `apps/`, with its own Vercel deployment, listed here as a tile.

> Read this whole file before doing anything. The rules below are not suggestions — they are the project's spine.

> **Monorepo:** the portfolio is one repo. Each app lives in `apps/<name>/`; shared docs live at
> the root (`CLAUDE.md`, `SCHEMA_RULES.md`). Tooling is npm workspaces + Turborepo. A new app is
> a new folder under `apps/` — no new GitHub repo, no new access grant. Each app is still its own
> Vercel project (Root Directory `apps/<name>`); production ships from `main` for all apps in
> lockstep, with rollback via Vercel's deployment history.

## Who and what

- **Owner:** `Mantas` (`markamantas9@gmail.com`), GitHub `Mantukasss`.
- **Workflow:** Code is pushed from agent sessions, Vercel auto-deploys, the owner tests on the live URL. Local dev in an agent sandbox is fine and encouraged when useful (iterating on visuals, sanity-checking with `next dev`), but **the source of truth is the GitHub repo** — nothing ships without being committed and pushed.
- **Goal:** Ship PWAs fast and iterate. Each app should be shippable in 1–2 sessions. The hub lists them.
- **Hard constraint: 100% free to run.** Vercel free tier + Supabase free tier. If a request would require ANY other paid service, **stop and flag it before implementing.**

---

## The four iron rules — never violate

### 1. No hardcoded URLs anywhere except `apps/hub/config/apps.json`
All cross-app and hub→app URLs live in that one file. This makes a future custom-domain migration a single-file diff. If you find yourself typing `vercel.app` in any code file other than `apps/hub/config/apps.json`, stop.

### 2. Schema is additive — forever
Add columns / tables / JSON fields. **Never rename, never delete, never narrow a type.** Users running older versions of an app must always be able to read/write data created by newer versions. The root `SCHEMA_RULES.md` is canonical; each app folder may add its own. Check before any migration.

### 3. One Supabase project for all apps
Namespace tables per app via Postgres schemas: `focus_gate.tasks`, `workout.sessions`, etc. One Google login covers the whole portfolio. Never create a new Supabase project for a new app.

### 4. Row Level Security on every user-data table
Users can only `SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` rows where `user_id = auth.uid()`. Every user-data table has `user_id uuid references auth.users not null` and RLS enabled. No exceptions.

---

## Stack — non-negotiable

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Radix Colors (dark mode only)
- **PWA:** Every app AND the hub are installable PWAs (manifest + service worker)
- **Hosting:** Vercel free tier, `mantas-*` project names
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth) free tier — one shared project, Google OAuth
- **Code:** GitHub — a single monorepo (`apps/*` + shared root tooling), npm workspaces + Turborepo
- **Icons:** Tabler icons — map icon-name strings to Tabler components in code
- **Auth:** Google OAuth via Supabase, single account covers the whole portfolio

---

## Architecture

Each app = a folder under `apps/` + its own Vercel project (Root Directory `apps/<name>`) + its own `*.vercel.app` URL. Apps stay independent at runtime — one breaking doesn't affect others. The hub just reads `config/apps.json` and renders tiles.

### Deployment model

All apps ship in lockstep from `main` (one monorepo). Each app's Vercel project sets Root Directory `apps/<name>` and an Ignored Build Step so a push only rebuilds the apps that actually changed — this repo does it in-repo via each app's `vercel.json` `ignoreCommand` calling `scripts/vercel-ignore.sh` (see `docs/vercel-ignore-build.md`). There are **no** per-app `stable`/`previous` branches — roll back via Vercel's instant rollback (promote a previous deployment). `config/apps.json` records each app's production URL only.

### `config/apps.json` — schema and example

```json
{
  "apps": [
    {
      "slug": "focus-gate",
      "name": "Focus Gate",
      "description": "Intentional Instagram replacement",
      "icon": "brain",
      "iconImage": "/app-icons/focus-gate.png",
      "color": "purple",
      "versions": {
        "stable": "https://mantas-focus-gate.vercel.app"
      },
      "added_at": "2026-01-01"
    }
  ]
}
```

Field rules: `slug` is kebab-case and matches the app's folder name under `apps/`. `icon` is a Tabler icon name (no `Icon` prefix) — **and must be mapped in `apps/hub/src/lib/icons.ts`** or the tile falls back to a generic icon. `iconImage` is optional and preferred (the app's real PWA icon, copied to `apps/hub/public/app-icons/<slug>.png`). `color` is one of: `coral`, `teal`, `purple`, `amber`, `blue`, `pink`, `green`, `gray`.

The repo ships with `"apps": []` — the hub renders an empty state until the first app is registered.

### Hub-specific Supabase tables

In a `hub` schema: `hub.user_app_preferences` — `(user_id, app_slug, preferred_version, updated_at)`. Reserved for a future per-version picker; **not currently used** — tiles open `stable`. (Kept in place per the additive-only rule.)

---

## Per-app context files (`apps/<name>/CLAUDE.md`)

Every app folder carries **two docs**, and every app must have both:

- **`apps/<name>/README.md`** — human / GitHub facing: what the app is, the idea, how to run it.
- **`apps/<name>/CLAUDE.md`** — shared agent context for working *inside* that app. Claude Code auto-loads a nested `CLAUDE.md`; other agents must read it explicitly before touching that app, so app-specific rules belong here (the README is not the handoff source).

Every `apps/<name>/CLAUDE.md` uses these sections, in order:
**Stack · Conventions · Data model · Gotchas · Current state · Next**.

**Keep `Current state` and `Next` live.** Update them as part of the same change — after every interaction that alters the app, not only at the end of a session. They must always describe the app as it is *right now* and what's queued next. No dates; just the two sections.

So: when you start work in an app, **read its `CLAUDE.md`**; when you change it, **update that file's `Current state` / `Next`**. This root file stays portfolio-wide; app-specific detail lives in each app's `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Visual style — applies to the hub AND every app

### Mode
**Dark mode only.** No light mode, no system toggle.

### Color foundation — Radix Colors

Use the [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) palette (`@radix-ui/colors`). Import dark variants only. **Step semantics:** 1–2 = page backgrounds · 3–5 = UI element backgrounds · 6–8 = borders · 9–10 = solid backgrounds · 11–12 = text.

**Neutral base: `mauve`** — import `@radix-ui/colors/mauve-dark.css`.

| Token | Radix var | Hex |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Background | `--mauve-1` | `#161618` |
| Surface | `--mauve-3` | `#232326` |
| Surface elevated | `--mauve-4` | `#28282c` |
| Border subtle | `--mauve-6` | `#3a3a3f` |
| Border focus | `--mauve-8` | `#504f57` |
| Text low | `--mauve-9` | `#7e7d86` |
| Text muted | `--mauve-11` | `#a09fa6` |
| Text | `--mauve-12` | `#ededef` |

### Accent palette

| Name | Radix scale | Hex |
|------|-------------|-----|
| `coral` | `red` | `#e5484d` |
| `teal` | `teal` | `#12a594` |
| `purple` | `purple` | `#8e4ec6` |
| `amber` | `amber` | `#ffb224` |
| `blue` | `blue` | `#0090ff` |
| `pink` | `pink` | `#d6409f` |
| `green` | `green` | `#30a46c` |
| `gray` | `mauve` step 7 | `#46464d` |

In `tailwind.config.ts`:

```ts
colors: {
  bg: 'var(--mauve-1)',
  surface: 'var(--mauve-3)',
  'surface-elevated': 'var(--mauve-4)',
  border: 'var(--mauve-6)',

## Supabase project

One shared project for the whole portfolio (iron rule #3). Project ref: `tsyozhctvotcgqpqrbrr`.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` live in the session env vars and are injected automatically into every Vercel project by the setup script. The anon key is public by design (RLS gates every query). The `service_role` key and DB password are never in app code — the owner's password manager only.

---

## Session env vars — all keys

All set in the agent session's env vars panel. Available every session.

### `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- GitHub Personal Access Token (classic), scopes: `repo` + `workflow`
- Used by the GitHub MCP server for all git operations
- Renew: github.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens

### `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- Vercel API token
- Used by `apps/hub/scripts/setup-vercel-project.mjs`
- Renew: vercel.com → Settings → Tokens
- Requires `api.vercel.com` in the network allowlist

### `VERCEL_TEAM_ID`
- Vercel account/team ID — scopes API calls
- Find: vercel.com → Settings → General → Your ID
- Never changes

### `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- Supabase Personal Access Token — Supabase Management API
- Used to run SQL migrations and set auth redirect URLs
- Renew: supabase.com → avatar → Account → Access Tokens
- Requires `api.supabase.com` in the network allowlist
- Do not commit anywhere

### `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- URL of the shared Supabase project. Never changes.
- Injected into every Vercel project automatically by the setup script

### `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Public anon key. Safe in client bundles (RLS enforces access).
- Injected into every Vercel project automatically by the setup script
- Renew only if regenerated: supabase.com → project → Settings → API

### `GEMINI_API_KEY` (optional — only if an app uses AI)
- Google AI Studio key
- Model: `gemini-flash-latest` (rolling alias — always the current free-tier flash model; pinned names lose their free quota and 429 on every call)
- Renew: aistudio.google.com → Get API key
- **Must be added manually to each Vercel project that uses AI** — the setup script only injects Supabase vars
- Call server-side only. Always write a graceful fallback. Use `generationConfig: { responseMimeType: 'application/json' }` for structured output.
- **Best for:** higher-quality drafting, nuanced instruction following, longer context.

### `GROQ_API_KEY` (optional — only if an app uses AI)
- Groq free-tier key (no credit card required)
- OpenAI-compatible endpoint: `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`
- **Must be added manually to each Vercel project that uses it**
- Call server-side only. Always write a graceful fallback (e.g. to Gemini).
- **Best for:** speed-critical work, high-volume structured extraction, daily cron jobs, when latency matters more than the last bit of quality.

### Network allowlist

Add these to the outbound allowlist in the agent's environment settings:
- `api.vercel.com` — needed for Vercel project creation
- `api.supabase.com` — needed for SQL migrations and auth config
- `api.groq.com` — needed if testing Groq from agent sessions

---

## Full automation — new app checklist

With all tokens set and both domains allowlisted, a new app goes from idea to live with no new repo:

1. ✅ **App folder + docs** — scaffold under `apps/<name>` (Next.js 15, Tailwind, Supabase SSR, PWA); it joins the workspace automatically via the `apps/*` glob. **Create `apps/<name>/README.md` and `apps/<name>/CLAUDE.md`** (CLAUDE.md sections: Stack · Conventions · Data model · Gotchas · Current state · Next — see *Per-app context files*). `apps/hub` is the reference implementation to copy from.
2. ✅ **Register** — add the entry to `apps/hub/config/apps.json` and map its icon in `apps/hub/src/lib/icons.ts`
3. ✅ **Vercel project** — `node apps/hub/scripts/setup-vercel-project.mjs --repo Projects --name mantas-<name> --slug <name>` (creates the project, sets Root Directory `apps/<name>` and production branch `main`, injects Supabase env vars). Add the app's `vercel.json` with the `ignoreCommand` so pushes only rebuild what changed.
4. ✅ **SQL migration** — `POST https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/tsyozhctvotcgqpqrbrr/database/query` (SQL lives in `apps/<name>/supabase`)
5. ✅ **Auth redirect URL** — `PATCH https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/tsyozhctvotcgqpqrbrr/config/auth`
6. ✅ **Commit & push to `main`** — Vercel deploys the new project

**Still manual:** add `GEMINI_API_KEY` and/or `GROQ_API_KEY` in the Vercel dashboard (if the app uses AI) + test on phone.

## Bootstrap automation (`scripts/`)

### `scripts/vercel-ignore.sh`
Path-based Ignored Build Step for the monorepo — each app's `vercel.json` calls it with its
folder name. Exits 0 (skip) when nothing under `apps/<name>` or shared root tooling changed.

### `apps/hub/scripts/setup-vercel-project.mjs`
Creates a Vercel project, links it to this GitHub repo, sets the production branch and Root
Directory `apps/<name>`, injects Supabase env vars from session env. Usage:

```bash
node apps/hub/scripts/setup-vercel-project.mjs --repo Projects --name mantas-<name> --slug <name>
```

---

## Workflow rules

- **Never push directly to `main` without confirmation** — it deploys every app.
- **Lockstep releases:** all apps ship from `main`; there are no per-app `stable`/`previous` branches. Roll back via Vercel's instant rollback.
- **Commit messages say why, not just what.**

---

## Multi-agent workflow

Multiple agents share this repo and must be able to **take over from each other mid-task with
no lost context**. The living docs ARE the handoff — **no separate handoff files**; this
applies to every app in the repo, not any one feature.

- **Claude Code** — auto-loads this root `CLAUDE.md` and the nested `apps/<name>/CLAUDE.md` when it touches that app's files.
- **Codex / other agents** — read root `AGENTS.md`, which routes here; they must also read the entire relevant `apps/<name>/CLAUDE.md` before changing that app.
- **Enter every task as a continuation.** Inspect the current branch, working tree, recent commits, and shared app context before editing. Preserve another agent's in-flight work.
- **The state of play lives in each app's `CLAUDE.md` → `Current state` / `Next`.** Keep them live — update them in the **same commit** as the code change, not just at session end.
- **Handing off:** put a one-line **`Handoff:`** note at the top of that app's `Next` (what's in flight · what's next · any risk). The successor deletes it once picked up.
- **Anything pushed is a valid resume point.** Commit + push frequently to the feature branch (never straight to `main` without confirmation) so the last push is a clean handoff.
- All agents use the same feature branch and update the same `CLAUDE.md` files.

### Shipping gotchas
- **Vercel occasionally misses the production build webhook** on merge. If `main`'s HEAD has
  no production deployment after a few minutes, trigger it manually:
  `POST https://api.vercel.com/v13/deployments?teamId=$VERCEL_TEAM_ID&forceNew=1` with
  `{name, project:<prj_id>, target:"production", gitSource:{type:"github", repoId:<id>, ref:"main", sha:<merge-sha>}}`,
  then poll `/v13/deployments/<id>` to `READY`.
- **Stop-hook "Unverified commit" noise:** after a squash-merge, GitHub's own merge commit
  (authored `noreply@github.com`) lands on `main` and the local branch tracks it. Ignore the
  unverified flag for merge commits you didn't author; only reset-author commits **you** wrote
  and haven't pushed.

---

## When asked to ADD A NEW APP — discovery first

Do **not** start building until the app is understood. Ask one question at a time with `AskUserQuestion`, picking whichever resolves the biggest remaining ambiguity:

- **The problem** — one sentence
- **Minimum shape** — simplest useful version; what's v2?
- **Core actions** — what does the user DO? (2–3 verbs)
- **Data model** — tables, columns. Confirm before any schema work — it's additive forever
- **Audience** — just the owner, or shared?
- **Offline?** — affects PWA/SW design
- **External APIs** — must be free tier
- **Identity** — slug, Tabler icon, palette color (lock last)

Summarise in 5–10 bullets and wait for thumbs-up. Then follow the **Full automation checklist** above.

---

## When asked to MODIFY AN EXISTING APP

App changes belong in that app's folder under `apps/`. Because it's one repo, cross-cutting changes can land in a single commit: the app's code, its schema in `apps/<app>/supabase`, the hub's `config/apps.json`, root tooling, and this `CLAUDE.md`. **After the change, update that app's `apps/<app>/CLAUDE.md` — especially its `Current state` and `Next` sections** (see *Per-app context files*).

---

## What I want from you

- **Concise.** No wall of text for small changes.
- **Ask, don't assume.** Especially on data model and anything user-visible.
- **Flag iron-rule conflicts loudly.**
- **Flag paid services immediately.** Free tier or bust.
- **No speculative abstractions.** Build what's in front of you.
- **Mobile-first, always.**

---

## How to actually build — failure modes to resist

### Don't agree just because I said it
Verify before agreeing. If I'm wrong, push back with the reason. Sycophancy lets bad patches ship.

### Fix root causes, never symptoms
- Don't delete the feature to fix its bug
- Don't silence errors with try/catch
- Don't work around a wrong assumption instead of fixing it
- Third time fixing the same bug = wrong diagnosis; re-architect

### Self-monitor for losing the plot
Signs: patching the same file three times, re-discovering things already known, hand-wavy output. When noticed: stop, commit what's stable, re-anchor or split to a fresh session.

---

## Current phase

**Fresh infrastructure — no apps yet.** `apps/hub` is the only app; `config/apps.json` is empty.
Work through `SETUP.md`, deploy the hub, then add the first real app via the *Full automation
checklist* above.
