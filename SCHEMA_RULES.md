# Schema rules

Read `CLAUDE.md` first; this is the short version of iron rule #2.

## The rule

**Schema changes are ADDITIVE ONLY. Forever.**

You may:
- Add a new column to an existing table
- Add a new table
- Add a new JSON field inside an existing JSON column
- Add a new index, policy, trigger, function

You may NEVER:
- Drop a column
- Rename a column
- Drop a table
- Rename a table
- Narrow a type (e.g. `text` → `varchar(50)`, `bigint` → `int`)
- Change a default value in a way that mutates existing rows
- Tighten a `NOT NULL` constraint on an existing column without a default for prior rows

## Why

Users running older installed copies of any app (PWAs linger on phones) must always be able to read AND write data created by newer versions, indefinitely. Apps may also **share tables** — a column one app stops using may still be required by another. If you drop or rename a column, something breaks.

This rule applies for the **entire lifetime of the project**. There's no migration window. Treat every schema change as forever.

## Exceptions granted so far

Only the project owner can grant one, and each is recorded here so the rule stays
honest rather than quietly eroded. **You may not grant yourself one.**

| Date | Change | Why it was safe |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| _(none yet)_ | | |

The bar: the feature was removed rather than migrated, the tables were verified **empty**
(0 rows) with **no** foreign keys or views referencing them, and no shipped client —
including a stale cached PWA — retains code that touches them. A table that any shipped
version still reads or writes does **not** qualify, no matter how unused it looks.

## What to do when you wish you could rename / drop

- **Rename:** add the new column, dual-write from app code until older versions retire, leave the old column in place forever.
- **Drop:** stop writing to it from app code, leave the column in place. It costs almost nothing.
- **Narrow a type:** don't. If app code needs a stricter shape, validate in code.

## Migrations

SQL lives under each app — `apps/hub/supabase/sql/`, `apps/<name>/supabase/migrations/`. Numbered files (`0001_…`, `0002_…`), each a one-time-apply script. Apply by pasting the file's contents into the Supabase SQL editor, or via the Management API:

```
POST https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/tsyozhctvotcgqpqrbrr/database/query
```

Before opening any migration: re-read this file.

## New Postgres schemas — Data API exposure (two places, not one)

Adding a new per-app schema (iron rule #3) is not visible to PostgREST until **both** of
these list it, and they can silently diverge:

1. The platform config — `PATCH https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/<ref>/postgrest`
   (`db_schema`), i.e. the dashboard's "Exposed schemas".
2. The `authenticator` role's own setting, which **overrides** the config on the running
   server: `alter role authenticator set pgrst.db_schemas = '<full list incl. new schema>';`

After changing them, force PostgREST to pick both up:

```sql
notify pgrst, 'reload config';
notify pgrst, 'reload schema';  -- also refreshes the table/schema cache
```

Symptoms of getting this wrong: `Invalid schema: <name>` (role setting stale) and
`Could not find the table '<schema>.<table>' in the schema cache` (schema cache stale).
This bites for real every time a new schema is added — the config has it, the role doesn't,
and every API call fails until the role is updated and both reloads are sent.
